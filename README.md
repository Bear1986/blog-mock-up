This layout was inspired by something on Dribble: https://dribbble.com/shots/18089191-Blog-Layout

I wanted to try to recreate it, and I think it turned out pretty well.
The only thing I deliberately kept in on the mobile version was the social media icons, because I think they're important to keep on the mobile version.

I hope you enjoy it!
